**Event Countdown Timer - IEEE Technovate 2025**
A sleek, feature-rich, and immersive countdown timer application built for the IEEE Technovate 2025 competition. This project was developed by Abhijeet Gautan and Ayush Gupta, students of BCA at the Maharishi University of Information Technology, Lucknow.

**üöÄ Overview**
This is not just a simple timer. It's a fully interactive web application designed to build anticipation for any event. Users can set a custom event name and date, choose a theme that fits the mood, and watch the seconds tick down with exciting audio-visual feedback. When the countdown hits zero, the celebration begins with a dynamic fireworks display and sound effects!

**‚ú® Features**
This project is packed with features to create a polished and engaging user experience:

**Custom Events:** Users can set a name and a precise future date and time for any event.

**Live Countdown:** A real-time display breaks down the remaining time into days, hours, minutes, and seconds.

**Dynamic Themes:** Choose from 8 beautiful, high-resolution themes (like Celebration, Cosmic, and Gaming) that change the background image and UI color scheme.

**Immersive Audio:**

An optional ticking sound for each passing second.

A celebratory sound when the countdown finishes.

Synchronized firework launch and explosion sound effects.

A simple Mute/Unmute control for all audio.

**Fireworks Finale:** A stunning, procedurally generated fireworks display on a <canvas> element when the timer completes.

Shareable Links: Generate a unique URL for your countdown to share with friends, family, or colleagues.

Focus Mode: A minimalist view that hides UI elements to put full focus on the countdown timer itself.

Responsive Design: Looks great on desktops, tablets, and mobile devices.

Persistent Settings: The app remembers your last used theme and mute preference using local storage.

**üõ†Ô∏è Technologies Used**
This project was built from the ground up using core web technologies, with no external frameworks.

**HTML5:** For the structure of the application.

**CSS3 & Tailwind CSS:** For modern styling, responsive design, and a utility-first workflow.

**JavaScript:** For all the application logic, including:

Date and time calculations for the countdown.

DOM manipulation.

Web Audio API: For synthesizing all sound effects (tick, completion, and fireworks) from scratch, requiring no audio files.

HTML5 Canvas: For the dynamic and random fireworks animation.
